### Solutions for Philanthropy
[Foundant Technologies](https://www.foundant.com) makes philanthropy easier and more impactful for funders, nonprofits, scholarship providers, and community foundations.

From October 2019 to December 2023, I led and worked on a variety of teams to solve accounting, fundraising, and CRM needs for nonprofits. I was an advocate for iterative, test-driven, and continuous delivery practices with domain-driven design and event storming. I also had the opportunity to mentor juniors and new engineering hires during a period of rapid growth, practice pair programming, and give numerous lunch & learns on a wide variety of topics.

I built, monitored, and maintained dozens of customer-facing back-end services and front-end UIs. To support these services, we created an event-driven microservice platform on AWS with Terraform, Go, Docker, and Vue.js. I also implemented cross-cutting platform utilities for authentication, authorization, REST API generation, CI/CD pipelines, event sourcing, and new service generation.
