After trying out many of the other open-source options available, I decided to write a simple app to send files quickly and securely.

- Containerized web app written in Go & vanilla Javascript
- Upload a file and generate sharable links
- Single admin user authentication
- File expiration time can be set by duration or date
- Password-protect file access
