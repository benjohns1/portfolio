### Professional Services
RightNow Technologies was a CRM software provider purchased by Oracle in 2012. As a technical consultant there from August 2010 through December 2012, I worked closely with clients throughout discovery, design, implementation, and support of custom integration solutions. I worked on and eventually led large projects in the financial, health, and public sectors.
